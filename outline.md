# Agile Operations Outline:

1. Introduction
    *   DevOps is a subset of AgileOps
    *   Culture always wins
    *   CI/CD is only the beginning
1.  Overview of what Agile Operations (AgileOps) is
    *   Leveraging Agile practices in an interrupt-driven environment
    *   The Agile Manifesto for ops
    *   The two-way street of shared practices
    *   High-level view of IDD
    *   Supporting roles
    *   A different definition of the customer
    *   AgileOps features are not just software
1.  The Cloud Native Revolution and DevOps/AgileOps
    *   New operational paradigms
    *   Why Kubernetes changes everything about DevOps/AgileOps
    *   Hybrid clouds and hybrid support models
    *   Staffing for the cloud
1.  Lessons learned from DevOps and why AgileOps is necessary (aka Agile First, DevOps happens naturally)
    *   Overview of where DevOps gaps exist
    *   So, you already have DevOps and it is not working for you, and you want to migrate to AgileOps
    *   DevOps matrix (Tools/process/People -> Program/Portfolio/Team)
    *   Case studies
1.  The Agile Enterprise (architecture, development, testing, compliance, security, tools, operations, support)
    *   A compelling narrative of what enterprise agility looks like
    *   What we're talking about when we say "Agile Transformation" hint: _it's not everyone doing Scrum_
    *   Agile architecture
    *   Agile development
    *   Agile testing principles
    *   Agile security
    *   Supporting customers
    *   DevOps tooling
    *   Extending to the rest of the enterprise from legal to marketing
1.  The organic evolution of technology organizations
    *   Startup/early phase (DevOps means different things at different stages!)
    *   Early success and role emergence
    *   Growth company
    *   Success company
    *   Sustainable company
    *   Every enterprise is now a software company
    *   Challenges of overcoming "tribal knowledge"
1.  Operations at scale (patterns over proscription)
    *   The power of the pattern vs. the culture of "don't change things"
    *   Servant leadership - more important than ever
    *   Dancing with IT Service Management, ITITL, COBIT, and other highly-restrictive operations frameworks
    *   Big room planning and where ops fits in
1.  Anatomy of an Agile Operations culture (hello world infra, etc.)
    *   _Change_ is not the enemyâ€¦ _unknown_ change is
    *   MVP in operations and the concept of "Hello World" infrastructure
    *   Mapping the path of the value stream through Operations
    *   Engineering best practices; not just for software developers (testing, pairing, principles, patterns, config management, code revision, no one-offs)
    *   Engineering happiness and retention (feeling like you never get anything done is demoralizing)
1.  The role of intentional architecture in AgileOps
    *   Intentional versus organic architecture
    *   Managing architectural runway
1.  Supporting roles in an Agile Operations group 
    *   The Operations PO
    *   "scrum master"
    *   feature lead (will have more detail in chapter 9)
    *   team architect
    *   Team-level host leadership
    *   Agile coach
1.  Introduction to Infrastructure-Driven Development
    *   Origin of IDD and why it matters
    *   JEDI principle
    *   Role of the feature lead
    *   Interfacing with other teams/product owners
    *   Standups
    *   Backlog grooming
    *   Planning cadence
    *   Unplanned work
    *   Tracking with Agile metrics
1.  AgileOps antipatterns
    *   separate devops group
    *   embedding into teams
    *   developers on first-line call
    *   DevOps without Agile
    *   Case studies
1.  Supporting technologies
    *   The power of ALM tools
    *   Chat vs. email/txt
        *   ChatOPS
        *   Incident management
        *   cross-team/dept. collaborations
        *   flow of interrupts
    *   DevOps tooling translated
    *   CI/CD in plain English
    *   TDD for infrastructure
1.  Interrupts: the killer of predictability
    *   Tracking
    *   Person of the week / innovative on-call approaches
    *   Proactive monitoring to limit interrupts
    *   Finding your planned/unplanned ratios for planning
1.  Where to go from here
    *   Agile Operations in scaled Agile frameworks (DAD, LeSS, SAFe, etc.)
    *   Radical complexity
    *   Distributed teams
    *   Global/massive scaling
    *   Interdependencies
